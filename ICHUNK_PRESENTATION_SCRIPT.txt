SLIDE 1: INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: Title slide with iChunk logo]

Good morning! My name is [YOUR NAME], and today I'm excited to present
iChunk Optimizer - an AI-powered data processing and semantic search
platform for structured data.

[PAUSE]

[SHOW: Problem slide]

Let me start with the problem we're solving. In today's world, organizations
deal with massive amounts of structured data - customer records, product
catalogs, transaction logs, marketing campaigns. The challenge is:

First, how do you make this data searchable by meaning, not just by keywords?
Traditional search engines fail at understanding semantic relationships.

Second, how do you prepare this data for AI systems like LLMs that have
token limits and need well-structured context?

Third, how do you handle different data types - transactional, entity-based,
temporal - each requiring different processing strategies?

These are exactly the problems iChunk Optimizer solves.

[PAUSE]

Let me show you how it works.

================================================================================
SLIDE 2: SYSTEM OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: Architecture diagram]

iChunk Optimizer is a complete platform with three main components:

One, intelligent chunking. The system offers five different chunking strategies
- Fixed, Recursive, Semantic, Document-based, and our unique Agentic chunking
that uses AI to analyze data and select the optimal strategy.

Two, vector embeddings. We convert text into high-dimensional vectors that
capture semantic meaning. We support both local models and OpenAI embeddings.

Three, semantic search. With FAISS and ChromaDB, users can search by meaning
with similarity matching and metadata filtering.

[CLICK TO: Mode options]

The system offers four processing modes:

- Config-1 Mode: Quick setup with basic chunking
- Deep Config Mode: Advanced customization with preprocessing
- Campaign Mode: Specialized for marketing data with record-based chunking
- Fast Mode: One-click processing for common use cases

Let me now demonstrate these capabilities with live examples.

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: LIVE DEMO - CONFIG-1 MODE
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[OPEN: Browser with iChunk Optimizer]

Let me start with a real-world scenario. I have a customer transaction dataset
with 10,000 rows. I want to make it searchable for customer support queries.

[SHOW: Upload interface]

First, I'll upload the CSV file. The system automatically reads the structure.

[CLICK: Upload]

Now I'll select Config-1 Mode for quick processing. I can choose my chunking
method - let's use Fixed chunking with 500 rows per chunk.

[SHOW: Chunking options]

For embeddings, I'll use the default paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model which
is fast and efficient. For storage, I'll use FAISS for maximum performance.

[CLICK: Run Processing]

Let's run the pipeline.

[SHOW: Processing progress]

Watch the system chunking the data... Now generating embeddings... And
storing in the vector database. This usually takes about 30 seconds for
10,000 rows.

[WAIT FOR: Processing complete]

[SHOW: Search interface]

Perfect! Now I have a searchable vector database. Let me demonstrate semantic
search.

Let's say a user asks: "Find customers who made high-value purchases last month"

[TYPE: "customers high value purchases last month"]

[CLICK: Search]

Look at the results. The system returned chunks from customers who:
- Spent over $5000
- Made purchases in December
- Bought premium products

This is semantic search in action - the system understands "high value"
means expensive purchases, not just literal text matching.

[SHOW: Export options]

And I can export the processed data for further analysis or downstream systems.

================================================================================
SLIDE 4: LIVE DEMO - AGENTIC CHUNKING
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: New data file]

Now let me show you our unique Agentic Chunking feature. This is where AI
analyzes your data and decides the optimal chunking strategy.

I have a customer profile dataset with mixed data types - customer information,
order history, and product preferences all in one dataset.

[SHOW: Deep Config Mode]

Let's select Deep Config Mode and upload this data. Notice I now have access
to Advanced Chunking options.

[SHOW: Chunking method dropdown]

Instead of manually choosing a method, I'll select Agentic Chunking. This tells
the AI to analyze the data structure and recommend the best approach.

[SELECT: Agentic chunking]

I can provide context to guide the AI: "Analyze customer behavior for
personalization"

[ENTER: User context]

Let's run the agentic pipeline.

[SHOW: AI analysis in progress]

Watch the AI analyzing the schema. It's checking:
- Column types and relationships
- Entity identification
- Data patterns and structure

[WAIT FOR: AI recommendation]

The AI selected Entity-centric chunking strategy. Here's its reasoning:

"Detected customer_id as primary entity. Grouping transactions by customer
preserves purchase history and enables customer-level personalization queries."

[SHOW: Metadata with AI reasoning]

Notice the metadata now includes AI reasoning for each chunk. This is
transparent explainability.

[SHOW: Search results]

Now when I search for "customer purchase patterns", the system returns
complete customer profiles, not fragmented transaction records. This is because
the AI understood that grouping by customer was more important than grouping
by transaction date.

This is the power of agentic chunking - intelligent, context-aware data
preparation.

================================================================================
SLIDE 5: LIVE DEMO - CAMPAIGN MODE SEARCH
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: Campaign data]

Now let's look at Campaign Mode, designed specifically for marketing data.

I have automotive sales campaign data with leads, vehicles, and customer
information.

[SHOW: Campaign Mode interface]

Notice the specialized fields:
- Lead source
- Vehicle type
- Price range
- Customer type
- Purchase probability

[SHOW: Record-based chunking]

Campaign Mode uses record-based chunking - each complete lead record becomes
one chunk. This preserves the marketing context for each lead.

[RUN: Campaign processing]

Let's process this data.

[SHOW: Search interface with campaign-specific fields]

Now look at the search interface. It's tailored for campaign queries.

[ENTER: "walk-in leads interested in SUVs"]

[CLICK: Search]

The results show contact groups. Watch this - each result is not just a chunk,
but a complete lead record with all marketing data.

[CLICK: Expand first result]

Here's a complete lead:
- Lead ID: AUTO-6EAB18CC
- Vehicle: Truck
- Brand: Toyota
- Lead source: Walk-in
- Customer type: Repeat Customer
- Price range: $50k-$75k
- Purchase probability: 77%

And I can see similar leads grouped together by similarity. This is invaluable
for sales teams to understand lead clustering and prioritize follow-ups.

[SHOW: Multiple records per group]

Notice this group contains 23 similar leads. Sales can now target an entire
clustering of leads at once, rather than individual follow-ups.

This is campaign intelligence - powered by intelligent chunking and semantic
grouping.

================================================================================
SLIDE 6: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: Architecture diagram]

Let me walk you through the technical architecture.

[POINT TO: Chunking layer]

First, chunking. The system supports five methods:
- Fixed: Simple row-based chunking
- Recursive: Text-aware splitting with token limits
- Semantic: K-means clustering on embeddings
- Document-based: Group by key columns
- Agentic: AI-driven strategy selection

[POINT TO: Embedding layer]

Second, embeddings. We use Sentence Transformers - specifically
paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 which is 384-dimensional and extremely fast. For
enterprise users, we support OpenAI embeddings for higher quality.

[POINT TO: Storage layer]

Third, storage. We support both FAISS and ChromaDB:
- FAISS: Maximum performance, fastest search
- ChromaDB: Built-in persistence and metadata filtering

[POINT TO: Retrieval layer]

Fourth, retrieval. We use cosine similarity for semantic search with optional
metadata filtering. This enables queries like "find chunks where category is
electronics and price is high".

[SHOW: RAG workflow]

And finally, the RAG pipeline. The system retrieves relevant chunks based on
meaning, assembles them into context, and generates answers using Google Gemini.

This complete pipeline from raw data to intelligent answers - all in one platform.

================================================================================
SLIDE 7: KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

SLIDE 11: Q&A SESSION
================================================================================

PRESENTER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[SHOW: Q&A slide]

Thank you for your attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

[PAUSE]

[COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS]

Q: How does agentic chunking work under the hood?
A: We use Google Gemini API to analyze data schemas. The AI identifies entity
relationships, data patterns, and recommends chunking strategies based on
these insights. The system then executes the recommended strategy automatically.

Q: Can I use my own embedding models?
A: Yes. The system supports any Sentence Transformer model. You can even use
OpenAI embeddings for higher quality. Just configure the model name and API key.

Q: What's the scalability?
A: We've tested up to 1 million rows on a standard server. FAISS can handle
billions of vectors. For larger datasets, we recommend IndexIVFFlat or IndexHNSW
for approximate search.

Q: How does this compare to traditional search?
A: Traditional keyword search finds "laptop" if you search "laptop". Semantic
search finds related products even if you search "notebook computer" or
"portable computer". It understands meaning, not just text matching.

Q: Is there a cloud version?
A: Currently available as self-hosted. Cloud version is planned for Q2 2025.
We're also open to custom deployments and white-label solutions.

Q: Can I integrate this with my existing systems?
A: Absolutely. The system exposes RESTful APIs. You can upload data
programmatically, run processing, and query results through API calls. We
have Python and JavaScript SDKs available.
